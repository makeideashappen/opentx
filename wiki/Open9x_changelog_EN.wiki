 == 1361 / Sep 04 2012 ==
 
 === [**all] ===
 * English TTS prompts have been improved (thanks Martin for that!)
 * Trim / Keys correctly displayed in DIAG screen (with a 18bytes flash saving on stock)
 * DBLKEYS far more reactive (with a 120bytes flash saving on stock)
 * Inactivity alarm enabled during first Warning Screens (THR / Switches / Alerts)
 * 3 new sounds: Beep1 .. Beep3 with short simple sounds
 * T-Cut template replaced by the Sticky T-Cut
 * An asterisk on a black background will appear on the main screen in case of a reboot of the Tx (should never appear of course, but... better to know if your Tx rebooted during a flight so you can file a bug report)
 
=== [**sky9x] ===
 * Temperature alarm
 * Consumption alarm (port from ersky9x)
 * 32000+ files may be displayed in the SD file manager ... for those who have many models

== 1335 / Aug 30 2012 ==

=== [**all] ===
 * Expos and Mixes may belong to a list of Flight Phases (not only FPx and !FPx)
 * Limits may be "symetrical". I let Kilrah explain ;)
 * Many voice improvements (on all platforms). We now have en, it, fr and cz TTS voices
 * Mixer may use as sources "raw" inputs (sticks without any DR/Expos applied). I let Kilrah explain ...
 * DSM Range Check (thanks to Bryan from gruvin9x)
 * New Custom Switches functions: d>=ofs (means difference between 2 values >= ofs) and |d|>=ofs<br>Typical usage: you want to know the Batt value each time it decreases by 0.1V or the Altitude each time it changes by 10meters.
 * Trainer functions / Instant Trim now have a checkbox to easily enable / disable them
 * Inverting the throttle channel on limits screen now shows a popup warning for confirmation
 * Inactivity alarm more frequent again (every 5 secs)
 * PPM polarity display corrected, was inverted
 * Free EEPROM count corrected
 * Haptic feedback fixes
 * [**MENU long] on a switch in Function Switches screen toggles between normal and momentary switch (THR <=> THRm, !THR <=> !THRm)
 * Differential now have 1% steps instead of 2% steps
 * New DBLKEYS option, when editing parameters:
   * right/left => invert
   * up/down => reset
   * up/right => +100
   * down/left => -100
 * Trims don't stop for good when reaching the middle anymore, but just pause half a second
 * Power reading fixed when current source is A1 or A2
 * Templates fixed to take account of the new curve system
 * RSSI Tx and Rx before A1 and A2 in telemetry item list - *this is not updated automatically, PLEASE CHECK YOUR SETTINGS!*
 * Telemetry-based custom switches do not trigger anymore when no data is received
 * Trim handling fixed on mixes using curves and differential
 * AUTOSWITCH option now reflects switches' physical positions
 * Expo / DRs now allows for EITHER a curve OR an expo value, not both (saves memory, and expo can be replicated on the curve if needed).
 
=== [**stock] ===
 * Volume with Voice Mod

=== [**gruvin9x] ===
 * DSM2 fixed
 * PPM16 fixed
 * Rotary encoder beeps fixed
 
=== [**sky9x] ===
 * USB bootloader launched only if Tx is OFF
 * Audio fixes
 * SD card fixes
 
----

== 1195 / Aug 1 2012 ==
=== [**all] ===
 * New curves system, all curves can now have 3, 5, 9 or 17 points, both with fixed, even-spaced X coordinates (e.g. 5pt), or user-defined X coordinates (e.g. 5pt')
 * Curves can be completely disabled (NOCURVES option) to save flash if not needed

=== [**stock] ===
 * !SmartieParts V2.2 backlight support (SP22 option)
 * Voice support (experimental)
