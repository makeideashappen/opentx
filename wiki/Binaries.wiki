#summary Download Latest openTx

= Download the latest openTx versions =

The memory size of the '9x radio is limited and it is not possible to add all features to the radio at the same time. In order to provide you with exactly the functions you need, the companion9x program can request  the build server to prepare a custom openTx version for you. companion9x will then automatically download your customized version and make it available for flashing to your radio.

For further information about companion9x, have a look at the project website: [http://code.google.com/p/companion9x/]

The following configuration options are currently available in companion9x:

|| *Option* || *Explanation* ||
|| PCB || The main board of the transmitter can be replaced by more powerful board versions that provide more features and computing power. openTx is available for the stock PCB, the gruvin9x v4 PCB or the ersky9x PCB ||
